### Hello, 

It's Kehinde. I create things that excites me; they could be potentially lasting.

Coding is an expression of the creative spark in me.

I am currently learning Data structures and Algorithms.

Currently reading [Patterns in the stone](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Stone-Computers-Science-Masters/dp/046502596X) and [a Philosophy of software design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201)
