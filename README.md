### Hello, 

Trying to create something that constitutes an artistic endeavour beyond myself.

Coding is an expression of the creative spark in me. I also really enjoy web accessibility and contributed a bit to Anki: **the best-spaced repetition app**

I am currently learning Data structures and Algorithms, `Ocaml` and `Rust`.

Currently reading [Patterns in the stone](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Stone-Computers-Science-Masters/dp/046502596X) and [a Philosophy of software design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201)
